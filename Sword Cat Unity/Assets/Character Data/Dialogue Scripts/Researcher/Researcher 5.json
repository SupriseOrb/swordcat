			 "The first sample of Purple Tumbleyarn yielded some explosive results, a find that had me very concerned.",
			 "The energy from the Oasis accumulates over time, but Purple Tumbleyarn has collected so much that it becomes unstable."
			 "If there is so much energy in the stuff, why do we use it to weave cloth and fabrics? What happens if we leave it be?",
			 "First, when woven together, it actually becomes more stable, like a lattice.",
			 "Second, the Tumbleyarn we don't catch, I suspect returns to the desert.",
			 "All that energy has to go somewhere. I believe this may be responsible for the intense sandstorms surrounding the Oasis.",
			 "As my mother alywas says, I suppose Sword Cats and our Weavers truly do keep the town safe.",
			 "Thank you for your contribtuion to my research Sword Cat. Our world truly is incredible.",
			 "There's much more to learn, but until then, keep up the good work and maintain balance for the good people of Oasis Town. Lifestreams guide you."
